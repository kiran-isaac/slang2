The internal list that all classes are made from should have the following 3 operations:
  1. Take
  2. Insert
  3. Peek

<- : Take
  Definately:
  a <- [i] : would remove the ith item from focus and put it into the object a
  a <- [i, j] : would remove the ith to jth and from focus place them on the object a
  
  Maybe:
  a <- : Top value from focus is removed and put on a
  a <- [..] : All values from focus are removed and put on a. Not sure how I feel about the syntax

-> : Insert
  Definately:
  a -> : push onto the end of the object
  a -> [i] : push into the ith position

  Maybe:
  a -> [i, j] : takes j-i items from the top of a and puts them onto focus

= : Peek (Like take but obviously does not mutate focus. Perhaps dont use equals)
  Definately:
    a = : the top value from focus is copied and put on a
    a = [i] : the ith value from focus is copied and put on a
    a = [i, j] : the ith to jth values from focus are copied and put on a

  Maybe:
    a = [..] : all values from focus are copied and put on a. Also not sure how I feel about the syntax
