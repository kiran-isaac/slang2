The internal list that all classes are made from should have the following 3 operations:
  1. Take
  2. Insert
  3. Slice
  4. Size

<- : Take
  Definately:
  a <- [i] : would remove the ith item from focus and put it into the object a
  a <- [i, j] : would remove the ith to jth and from focus place them on the object a

  Maybe:
  a <- : Top value from focus is removed and put on a
  a <- [..] : All values from focus are removed and put on a. Not sure how I feel about the syntax

-> : Insert
  Definately:
  a -> : push onto the end of the object
  a -> [i] : push into the ith position

  Maybe:
  a -> [i, j] : takes j-i items from the top of a and puts them onto focus

[i, j] : Slice : Returns a new list containing the ith to jth items from focus
  Definately:
  a = [i..j] : returns a new list containing the ith to jth items from focus
               if i or j are negative then theyre from the end. i must be less than j
  a = [i..]
  a = [..j]
  a = [i] : returns a new list containing ONLY the ith item from focus
            if i is negative, it counts from the end of the list. So -1 is the
            last item
  a = [..] : returns a new list containing all items from focus

size(): Size : Returns the number of items in focus
